# XDI Policy Language

A simple policy language to support XDI link contracts.

The goal of this project is to create a fully featured policy expression language that is human readable and compiles to XDI link contracts. 

We will start with a simpler language that creates link contracts for controlling messages on personal channels. 

See the [wiki](wiki) for more information.
